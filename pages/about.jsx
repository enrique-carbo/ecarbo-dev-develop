                in a South American country, Argentina. I like to listen to music, while I do exercises and life outdoors.</p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-2">I am a doctor, a specialist in general medicine and dermatology, which gives me a broad perspective of
                biological processes in general. Related to this, I like to investigate and study about the impact of nutrition
                on our health, so I try to lead a healthy life.</p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-2">My other great passion is <span className="font-bold">Computer Science</span>. I always accompany myself in my work as a health professional,
                but for some years now I have spent more time studying and practicing.</p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-2">I have researched and used electronic medical records for many years in general open source such as openEMR or GNUhealth.</p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-2">I have <span className="font-bold">3 years experience building Web Pages and PWA applications</span> with javascript libraries and frameworks.</p>

                <p className="text-lg">I do not want to forget to mention a very interesting tool that is related to previously mentioned technologies, such as <span className="font-bold">Robotic Process Automation or RPA</span>,
                which I think has a lot to grow in the future.</p>
